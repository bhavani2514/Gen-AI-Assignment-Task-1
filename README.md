# Gen-AI-Assignment-Task-1
Multi-Agent System using LangGraph

This project implements Task 1: Multi-Agent System as described in the Soulpage IT Solutions – GenAI Assignment.

The objective is to demonstrate:

Understanding of Agentic AI concepts

Use of LangGraph for agent orchestration

Multi-agent collaboration with clear role separation

Context/state flow between agents

The system is designed in a modular and extensible way, allowing easy integration with real LLMs (OpenAI, Groq, etc.).


Technologies Used
Python 3.10+
